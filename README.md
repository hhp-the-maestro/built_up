## *python hot_reloader*
  ### *The python hot reloader was made to get a nearly similar feel of working in google's flutter dev hot reloader,  This python hot reloader saves your file , reloads its and neglects any errors in your program by tracking the version of your file with no errors. Very appealing while doing app developement with pyqt, kivy, tkinter ,etc.where you won't need to run your program each and every time for even minimal testing of your developement.*
###  *The instruction for how to use this program is also provided as a function named help in the program. However the program must be imported and run from a seperate file and that's it you can do your developement while running your program along side with this hot_reloader.*

## **Usage**
### *Incase you have a file names script.py*
*import...*

class x():

    def...
  
        pass
   
    def...
  
        pass

def main():

    run = x()
  
 ### *you should always have a main() function with no arguments through which your program executes and do not call the main function in your program, do not use sys.exit() inside your program* 
 ### *Now you get the hot_reloader.py, create a new file some_file.py, and*
 import hot_reloader
 
 filename = 'script.py'     # the file file which you want to run
 
 hot_reloader.re_loader(filename)
 
 ### *The program seems to run only on linux, As for sure the program was set not to run into errors,  you don't need to get worried about it and running the reloader is simple and if help required there is a help function inside the hot_reloader which is same as the above provided instruction for quick reference*
 
 hot_reloader.help()
